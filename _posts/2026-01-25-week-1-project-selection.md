## Welcome to My Final Year Project Journey!

Hey there! Welcome to the first post of what I hope will be a really insightful journey through my final year project. I'm Oluwatunmise Raphael Shuaibu, a BEng Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering student at Middlesex University London, and this blog is going to document every step of building a **Perception and SLAM System for Autonomous Racing**.

This week has been all about laying the foundation—choosing the right project, doing initial research, and getting everything set up for the work ahead. Let me walk you through it!

## The Big Decision: Choosing My Project

Honestly, choosing a final year project is kind of a big deal. This is something I'll be working on for months, so it had to be something that would challenge me, teach me new skills, and ideally be something I'd actually enjoy working on.

I explored a few different options before landing on this one:

- **Investigating 3 Different Methods of Implementing Leader-Follower Robotic Arm** - This one was interesting, but felt a bit too similar to work I'd already done.
- **Robotic Arm Teleoperation Using Leap Motion and Machine Learning** - The idea of filtering out unintentional hand movements with ML was cool, but I wanted something with broader applications.

In the end, I chose the **Perception and SLAM System for Autonomous Racing** project. Why? Because it's a stronger project overall, and more importantly, it opens me up to skills I don't currently have. There's so much to learn here—computer vision, sensor fusion, simulation environments, ROS2 integration—and that's exactly what I wanted. A project that would push me into new territory.

## What Did I Actually Do in Week 1?

Week 1 was all about research and planning. Here's what I got up to:

###  Literature Review
I dove into academic papers to understand the fundamentals of perception systems and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). There's a lot of existing research in this space, and I wanted to understand what approaches have been tried, what works well, and where the challenges are.

If you're interested in what I've been reading, check out my [Literature Review](/fyp-perception-slam/literature-review/) page—I'll be updating it as I go.

###  Discussions with Teachers and Advisors
I had several conversations with my project supervisors and other teachers to refine my approach. These discussions were super helpful in clarifying the scope of the project and making sure I was heading in the right direction.

###  Videos and Online Resources
Beyond papers, I watched a bunch of videos on ROS2, YOLO object detection, and autonomous racing systems. YouTube and online courses are honestly such great resources for getting up to speed on new tech.

###  Planning and Proposal Submission
After all the research and discussions, I finalized my project proposal and submitted it. That felt like a big milestone! Now it's official.

###  Creating a Gantt Chart
To keep myself on track, I created a detailed implementation plan using a Gantt chart. You can see the full timeline on my [Gantt Chart](/fyp-perception-slam/gantt-chart/) page. Breaking the project down into phases and weeks makes it feel way more manageable.

## Looking Ahead: Week 2 Preview

So what's next? Week 2 is where the real work begins. Here's what I'm planning:

- **Write an introductory blog post** explaining what the Perception + SLAM problem actually is and why it matters for autonomous racing
- **Continue the literature review** by reading more papers and documenting key findings
- **Set up my development environment** (ROS2 Humble, Python dependencies, etc.)
- **Start implementing Node 1a** - the camera publisher that will read frames from test video and publish them to a ROS2 topic

I'm honestly pretty excited to get hands-on with the code. Week 1 was all planning and research, but Week 2 is when I actually start building things!

## Final Thoughts

Week 1 has been a solid start. I've got a clear plan, I understand the problem space better, and I'm ready to dive into implementation. There's definitely a lot to learn, and I'm sure I'll hit some roadblocks along the way, but that's part of the process.

If you're following along, thanks for being here! I'll be posting regular updates as I make progress. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or suggestions.

Let's build something cool! 🚀
